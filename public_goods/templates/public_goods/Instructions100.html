    <p>

    In this study, you will be in a randomly formed group of 3 participants, some of which may be
    robots. Each participant in the group is given 100 points, but you are the <i>group leader</i>, which
    was decided based on your performance in the previous task. You will go first. A point is
    equal to .01 cents.
    <br>
    The group has the opportunity to undertake a joint project. Each participant in the group
    decides how much they are going to contribute to the project. Contribution could be any
    integer from 0 to their total amount of points.
    <br>
    The earnings from the project are calculated as follows: The contributions of all of the
    participants are added up, the total contribution is multiplied by two, and the resulting
    amount is the total earnings from the project. These total earnings are evenly split among all
    of the participants. Your payoff equals your earnings from the project, plus the amount you
    did not contribute. Remember that how many points you end up with will affect your bonus
    payment.
