    Thank you for agreeing to participate.
    <br>
    You will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant or robot.
    <br>
    There are 100 points to split. Participant 1 will decide how much they will retain while the rest
    will go to Participant 2; the number of points you keep affects your bonus payment, while
    the number you give away can impact the other participant’s payout. 10 points is equal to one cent.
